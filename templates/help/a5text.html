For this assignment, the general question you are trying to answer is "What do we learn about bestsellers from this book?"  You need to produce an essay of about 2000-2500 words (8-10 typed, double-spaced pages), analyzing the book you've chosen. Do not recapitulate your biographical essay and/or your reception history here, and do not succumb to the temptation to review the book yourself. Once you have written your critical essay, cut and paste it into the text area below.</p>
